# Stick Cricket 3D

A modern 3D arcade cricket game inspired by the classic stick cricket concept but reimagined with immersive 3D graphics and enhanced gameplay mechanics.

## üèè Game Overview

Stick Cricket 3D transforms the simple timing-based cricket game into a fully immersive 3D experience. Players face a variety of bowling deliveries and must time their shots perfectly to score runs while avoiding getting out. The game combines the addictive simplicity of the original stick cricket concept with modern 3D graphics and physics.

## ‚ú® Planned Features

- **3D Environment**: Fully rendered cricket stadium with dynamic lighting and weather effects
- **Realistic Ball Physics**: Ball movement with spin, swing, and bounce properties based on real cricket physics
- **Multiple Shot Types**: Different shot options including drive, cut, pull, and defensive blocks
- **Varied Bowling Styles**: Face different types of bowlers (fast, medium, spin) with unique delivery patterns
- **Career Mode**: Progress through increasingly difficult levels and tournaments
- **Multiplayer Support**: Challenge friends to batting competitions
- **Customization**: Personalize your batter, bat, and equipment
- **Leaderboards**: Global and friend-based high-score tracking
- **Achievements**: Unlock special achievements for completing specific challenges
- **Realistic Sound Effects**: Stadium ambience, bat impacts, and crowd reactions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Game Engine**: Three.js for browser-based 3D rendering and graphics
- **Distribution Format**: Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **Physics**: Custom physics system for realistic ball and bat interactions
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Backend** (for multiplayer/leaderboards): Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for user data and scores
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker, deployable to cloud platforms

## üéÆ Game Controls (Planned)

- **Mouse/Touch Movement**: Position the bat and time your swing
- **Keyboard/Button Inputs**: Select shot type and power
- **Special Keys**: Activate power shots or special moves when available

## üîß Installation and Building (Future)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stick-cricket-3d.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd stick-cricket-3d

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Build the game into a single HTML file
npm run build
```

## üì¶ Distribution

The game is designed to be distributed as a single HTML file that contains:
- All necessary HTML structure
- Embedded CSS styles
- Embedded JavaScript including Three.js for 3D graphics
- All game assets (converted to data URLs where possible)

This approach makes the game easily shareable, deployable, and playable without complex installation requirements.

## üéØ How to Play

1. Wait for the bowler to deliver the ball
2. Time your shot precisely as the ball approaches
3. Choose the direction of your shot based on the delivery
4. Score runs and avoid getting out
5. Progress through increasingly difficult levels
